# Disease Risk Prediction Application :hospital:

## Overview :mag_right:

This project is a Flask-based web application designed to predict the risk of various diseases, including heart disease, diabetes, breast cancer, liver disease, and kidney disease. By leveraging machine learning models, our application provides users with an intuitive interface to input their health parameters and receive an immediate risk assessment for these diseases.

## Features :sparkles:

- **Multiple Disease Predictions**: Predict risk for heart disease, diabetes, breast cancer, liver disease, and kidney disease.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive web interface for users to input their data.
- **Instant Risk Assessment**: Quick processing of user input to provide a risk prediction based on sophisticated machine learning models.
- **Data Privacy**: Ensured privacy of user input data with no storage or collection.

## Technologies Used :gear:

- **Python**: Core programming language
- **Flask**: Web framework for building the application
- **Machine Learning**: Random Forest algorithm for accurate disease risk prediction
- **Pickle**: For loading pre-trained machine learning models
